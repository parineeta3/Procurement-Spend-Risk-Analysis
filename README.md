🧾 Procurement Spend & Risk Analysis

📊 A Power BI dashboard project designed to analyze supplier performance, procurement spend patterns, and operational risks using Microsoft Excel and Power BI.

---

## 🎯 Objective

To provide a data-driven overview of procurement health by identifying high-risk suppliers, financial losses, and delivery inefficiencies. The goal is to enable better vendor management decisions, cost optimization, and risk mitigation using business intelligence tools.

The dashboard consists of two key sections:

### 1️⃣ Supplier Performance Overview
- Tracks supplier reliability scores, delivery delays, and incident resolution status.
- Identifies top and low-performing vendors.
- Highlights supplier-wise financial loss by issue type (e.g., Delay, Payment, Quality).

### 2️⃣ Spend & Procurement Insights
- Displays total procurement spend and high-value orders.
- Shows purchase trends year-over-year (YoY).
- Includes regional, supplier, and category-wise spend analysis.
